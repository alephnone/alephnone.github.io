title: Hi, and welcome
---

I'm still working on this but I intend to use it as a blog to discuss my many interests and hobbies.
I'm a recent graduate with a Degree in Applied Mathematics. It's a very fancy piece of paper that qualifies me in the dark arts of data. 

I'll probably use this blog to talk about the data and relationships between various things as this is primarily how I likve to explore my hobbies. Posts will primarily be focused on


*   eSports, namely Overwatch
*   Cosplay and costuming in general
*   The datapoints that arise after trying to optimize every aspect of your daily life

And of course I'll share some personal ancedotes too. This is a welcome to me, for you.
